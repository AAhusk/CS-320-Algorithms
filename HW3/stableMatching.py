    in woman i's preference list.  That is, Pref_list[i-1] gives the
    obvious format for the preference list of woman i.

    The disadvantage of having each woman carry a preference list
    giving the men in descending order of preference is that it takes
    Theta(n) time in the worst case to determine whether a new suitor
    is higher in her preference list than her current fiance.  It is
    required to search her list to find the positions of the fiance
    and the new suitor to see who is higher.

    Since there are Theta(n^2) proposals in the worst case, that would cause 
    the stable matching algorithm to run in Theta(n^3) time.

    A better representation is Inv_pref_list, where Inv_pref_list[i-1][j-1]
    holds the position of man j in woman i's preference list.  This is
    the "inverse function" of the on mapping positions in the list to men.  
    It maps men to positions in the list.  To compare two men, j and k, to 
    see who is higher in i's list, just compare Inv_pref_list[i-1][j-1]
    and Inv_pref_list[i-1][k-1] to see which is a lower number.

    For this method, fill in code that computes Inv_pref_list from
    Pref_list in O(n^2) time.  There are Theta(n^2) elements in Pref_list,
    so this requires that you spend only constant time per entry.
